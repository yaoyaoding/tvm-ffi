"""Pluggable code generators for ``tvm-ffi-stubgen``.

The stub generator separates two concerns:

1. *Language-agnostic* infrastructure — reading the FFI reflection registry
   (:mod:`.lib_state`), parsing/writing marker blocks (:mod:`.file_utils`), and
   the abstract object/function metadata (:class:`.utils.ObjectInfo`,
   :class:`.utils.FuncInfo`). None of this knows or cares about the target
   language.
2. *Language-specific* rendering — turning that metadata into concrete source
   text, rendering a :class:`~tvm_ffi.core.TypeSchema` into a target-language
   type expression, and modelling that language's imports.

A :class:`Generator` encapsulates concern (2); ``cli.py`` drives concern (1) and
delegates every act of emitting text — and every act of collecting imports — to
the active generator. The import collector is opaque to the pipeline: ``cli.py``
asks the generator to create one, seed it from ``import-object`` directives, and
later render it, but never reaches inside. Adding a language is therefore
"implement one more :class:`Generator`" rather than forking the pipeline.
