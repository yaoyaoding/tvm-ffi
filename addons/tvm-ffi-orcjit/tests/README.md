# TVM-FFI-OrcJIT Tests

This directory contains tests for the tvm-ffi-orcjit package.

## Building Test Objects

The tests require pre-built object files. To build them:

```bash
cd tests
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

This will compile `sources/test_funcs.cc` and generate `test_funcs.o` in the tests directory.

## Running Tests

After building the test objects, run the tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Or from the repository root:

```bash
cd addons/tvm-ffi-orcjit
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Test Structure

- `sources/` - C++ source files for test functions
- `test_basic.py` - Python test cases
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration for test objects
- `test_funcs.o` - Generated object file (after building)

## CI/CD

The CI workflow automatically builds the test objects before running tests. See `.github/workflows/tvm-ffi-orcjit/ci_test.yml` for the full workflow.
