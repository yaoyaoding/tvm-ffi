"""TVM-FFI OrcJIT.

This module provides functionality to load object files (.o) compiled with TVM-FFI
exports using LLVM ORC JIT v2.

Example:
    >>> from tvm_ffi_orcjit import create_session
    >>> session = create_session()
    >>> lib = session.create_library()
    >>> lib.add("example.o")
    >>> func = lib.get_function("my_function")
    >>> result = func(arg1, arg2)
